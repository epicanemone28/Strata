/**
 * tile with a cardinal direction, the base for anything that turns to the four compass points (panes, doors, benches, stairs...). not for tiles that can also lie along the vertical axis, that's RotatableTile
 *
 * its blockstate must list facing = ["north", "east", "south", "west"] FIRST in [properties] so facing is always data % 4, other properties come after and multiply up from there (see PaneTile). the constructor checks this
 *
 * north is -Z, south +Z, west -X, east +X. facing is the way the FRONT points, placed by the player it faces them (like a furnace), so it's the opposite of their look direction
